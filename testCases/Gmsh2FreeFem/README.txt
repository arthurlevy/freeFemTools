This is an example of how to mesh a geometry using gmsh and import it in Freefem++
Original idea by Geordie McBain.

Just execute the script run.sh on any *nux machine where gmsh awk and FreeFem++ are installed

Includes
- geom.geo : geometry GMSH file
- 3to2.awk : script to ensure 2D compatibility
- freefemcode.edp :  freefem code


enjoy.
