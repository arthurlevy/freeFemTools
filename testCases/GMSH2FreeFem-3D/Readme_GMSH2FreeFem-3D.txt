These tutorials give some tips and tricks to generate 3D meshes using GMSH that can be imported in FreeFem++.

The first one, called "Tut1", proposes the generation of a simple cubic mesh and its import in FreeFem++.
The second one, called "Tut2", proposes the generation of a more sophisticated mesh composed of two regions.
The third (and for the moment last) one, called "Tut3", proposes the generation of the previous mesh but with periodic surfaces.
